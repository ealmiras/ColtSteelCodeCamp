    <h1>Common Blackbird</h1>
        <p>
            The <b>common blackbird</b> (<i>Turdus merula</i>) is a species of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_thrush">true thrush </a>. 
            It is also called the <b><i>Eurasian blackbird</i></b> (especially in North America, 
            to distinguish it from the unrelated New World blackbirds),
            [2] or simply the blackbird where this does not lead to confusion with a similar-looking local species. 
            It breeds in Europe, Asiatic Russia, and North Africa, and has been introduced to Australia and New Zealand.[3] 
            It has a number of subspecies across its large range; a few of the Asian subspecies are sometimes considered to be full species. 
            Depending on latitude, the common blackbird may be resident, partially migratory, or fully migratory.

        <p>
            The adult male of the common blackbird (Turdus merula merula, the nominate subspecies), 
            which is found throughout most of Europe, is all black except for a yellow eye-ring and bill and has a rich, 
            melodious song; the adult female and juvenile have mainly dark brown plumage. 
            This species breeds in woods and gardens, building a neat, cup-shaped nest, bound together with mud. 
            It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects, earthworms, berries, and fruits.

        <h2>Taxonomy and systematics</h2>
            <p>
                The common blackbird was described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae 
                as Turdus merula (characterised as T. ater, rostro palpebrisque fulvis).[4] 
                The binomial name derives from two Latin words, <i>turdus</i>, "thrush", and <i>merula</i>, "blackbird", 
                the latter giving rise to its French name, merle,[5] and its Scots name, merl.
